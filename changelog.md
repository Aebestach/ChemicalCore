# 0.5.0
- Added part upgrades for chemical resources (many of which were split from Chemical Propulsion 0.5.1)
- Added TEATEB (for Chemical Propulsion kerolox ignition)
- Rebalanced HTP cost to 0.5 per unit
- Minor localization tweaks
# 0.4.1
- Added N2F4
- Added "Liquid" to cryogenic resource names
- Added resource icon assets
# 0.4.0
- Renamed from "Immersive Chemical Core" to "Chemical Core"
# 0.3.1
- Readded tank definitions for stock liquids (LiquidFuel, Oxidizer and MonoPropellant) for better control of tank switching
- Fixed units-per-volume in B9 tank types
# 0.3.0
- Added HTP tank definition
- Balanced HTP cost to a more reasonable 0.2 per unit (vs. original CRP 2.1465!?)
- Added common resource colours to be used in part switches
- Added auto-computing of tank masses using a formula back-derived from CryoTanks definitions, keeps everything consistent and makes adding new resources simpler
# 0.2.0
